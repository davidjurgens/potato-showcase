# Empathetic Dialogue Annotation
# Based on Rashkin et al., ACL 2019
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/P19-1534/
# Dataset: https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmpatheticDialogues
#
# This task annotates emotional situations and evaluates empathetic responses.
# The goal is to train conversational agents that respond appropriately to
# users' emotional states.
#
# Emotion Categories (32 situations grouped):
# Positive: Joyful, Excited, Proud, Hopeful, Grateful, Content, Confident, Trusting
# Negative: Sad, Anxious, Angry, Afraid, Disgusted, Guilty, Lonely, Embarrassed
# Surprise: Surprised, Impressed, Curious
# Other: Nostalgic, Sentimental, Anticipating, Jealous, Devastated, Disappointed
#
# Empathy Components:
# - Emotional Reactions: Expressing appropriate emotions in response
# - Interpretations: Showing understanding of the situation
# - Explorations: Asking questions to understand better
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Identify the emotional situation the speaker describes
# 2. Evaluate if the response acknowledges the emotion
# 3. Rate the response's empathy level
# 4. Consider: Does the response make the speaker feel heard?
