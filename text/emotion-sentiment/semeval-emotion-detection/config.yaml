# Emotion Detection (SemEval-style)
# Based on SemEval shared tasks for emotion detection
#
# This configuration supports multi-label emotion classification
# with optional intensity ratings for detected emotions.
#
# Emotion Taxonomy (Ekman's basic emotions):
# - Joy: Happiness, pleasure, contentment, elation
# - Sadness: Grief, sorrow, melancholy, disappointment
# - Fear: Anxiety, worry, terror, apprehension
# - Anger: Frustration, irritation, rage, annoyance
# - Surprise: Astonishment, amazement (can be positive or negative)
# - Disgust: Revulsion, aversion, distaste
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Read the entire text before making judgments
# 2. Select ALL emotions that are expressed or evoked
# 3. An emotion is "expressed" if the author conveys feeling it
# 4. An emotion is "evoked" if the text would cause readers to feel it
# 5. Multiple emotions can co-occur (e.g., sad and angry)
# 6. "Neutral" should only be selected if NO emotion is present
# 7. For intensity, consider strength of emotional language
