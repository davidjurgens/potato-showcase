# RuSentiment - Social Media Sentiment Classification
# Based on Rogers et al., COLING 2018
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/C18-1064/
# Dataset: https://github.com/text-machine-lab/rusentiment
#
# 5-class sentiment scheme designed for social media:
# - Positive: explicit or implicit positive sentiment
# - Negative: explicit or implicit negative sentiment
# - Neutral: no sentiment expressed
# - Speech Act: formulaic posts (greetings, thanks, congratulations)
# - Skip: unclear, noisy, or user-generated content like poems
#
# Guidelines:
# - Mixed sentiment: annotate based on dominant sentiment
# - Hashtags and emojis are NOT automatic sentiment labels
# - Speech Acts may not reflect sender's actual sentiment
# - Annotation speed target: 250-350 posts per hour
