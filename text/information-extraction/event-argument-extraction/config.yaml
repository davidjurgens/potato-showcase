# Event Argument Extraction (MAVEN-Arg style)
# Based on Wang et al., ACL 2024
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.224/
# Dataset: https://github.com/THU-KEG/MAVEN-Argument
#
# MAVEN-Arg provides:
# - 162 event types with expert-written definitions
# - 612 argument roles across all event types
# - Document-level annotation (arguments can be anywhere in document)
# - Both entity and non-entity arguments
#
# This showcase demonstrates a subset of common event types and argument roles.
# Full schema available in the dataset download.
#
# Annotation process:
# 1. Identify event trigger (word/phrase indicating event occurrence)
# 2. Classify event type
# 3. Identify arguments filling semantic roles for that event
# 4. Arguments may be entities (linked) or non-entity spans
