# Clickbait Detection
# Based on clickbait detection research and shared tasks
#
# Clickbait Definition:
# Content designed to attract attention and encourage visitors to click
# on a link, often using sensationalized, misleading, or vague headlines.
#
# Clickbait Characteristics:
# - Curiosity gap: Withholding information to create curiosity
#   ("You won't believe what happened next...")
# - Sensationalism: Exaggerated claims or emotional language
#   ("SHOCKING revelation!", "This will BLOW your mind")
# - Listicles with enticing numbers: "10 things that will change your life"
# - Forward referencing: Using "this" without context
#   ("This one trick...", "This is why...")
# - Misleading framing: Title doesn't match content
# - Emotional manipulation: Triggering outrage, fear, or excitement
#
# Non-Clickbait Characteristics:
# - Informative and specific headlines
# - Accurate representation of content
# - Professional/journalistic tone
# - Complete information provided upfront
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Judge the headline/post in isolation (don't consider what article might say)
# 2. Focus on whether it uses manipulative techniques
# 3. A headline can be interesting without being clickbait
# 4. Sponsored content is not automatically clickbait
