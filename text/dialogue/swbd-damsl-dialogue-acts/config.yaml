# SWBD-DAMSL Dialogue Act Annotation
# Based on Jurafsky et al., 1997
# Manual: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/manual.august1.html
# Dataset: https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit
#
# Key principles:
# - Label based on pragmatic function, not grammatical form
# - Utterances can have both forward and backward functions
# - Context matters for interpretation
# - Default to sd (statement-non-opinion) when uncertain
#
# Forward functions: What the speaker is trying to accomplish
# Backward functions: How the utterance relates to previous turns
