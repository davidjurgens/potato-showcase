# Connotation Frames of Power and Agency
# Based on Sap et al., EMNLP 2017
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/D17-1247/
#
# Connotation frames capture how verbs implicitly project different
# levels of power and agency onto their participants.
#
# Key Concepts:
# - Agency: How much control/initiative does a participant have?
#   - High agency: "She decided", "He led"
#   - Low agency: "She was told", "He followed"
#
# - Power: Who has power over whom in the interaction?
#   - Agent has power: "She commands him"
#   - Theme has power: "She obeys him"
#   - Equal: "They collaborate"
#
# Applications:
# - Detecting gender bias in media portrayal
# - Analyzing power dynamics in narratives
# - Understanding implicit framing in text
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Focus on what the VERB implies, not the sentence context
# 2. Consider: Does this verb make the doer seem active/passive?
# 3. Consider: Does this verb give the doer power over others?
# 4. Think about typical usage, not edge cases

annotation_schemes:
  # Step 1: Agency of the subject
  - annotation_type: radio
    name: agency
    description: "How much AGENCY (control, initiative) does the verb imply for the subject?"
    labels:
      - "High agency"
      - "Moderate agency"
      - "Low agency"
      - "Neutral"
    tooltips:
      "High agency": "The subject is active, in control, making decisions (e.g., 'decides', 'leads', 'creates')"
      "Moderate agency": "The subject has some control but within constraints"
      "Low agency": "The subject is passive, reactive, or acted upon (e.g., 'follows', 'receives', 'is told')"
      "Neutral": "The verb doesn't clearly convey agency level"

  # Step 2: Power dynamics
  - annotation_type: radio
    name: power
    description: "Who has POWER in the relationship implied by the verb?"
    labels:
      - "Subject has power"
      - "Object has power"
      - "Equal power"
      - "No power dynamic"
    tooltips:
      "Subject has power": "The subject dominates or controls the object (e.g., 'commands', 'criticizes')"
      "Object has power": "The object has power over the subject (e.g., 'obeys', 'serves')"
      "Equal power": "Neither has power over the other (e.g., 'collaborates', 'discusses')"
      "No power dynamic": "The verb doesn't imply a power relationship"

  # Step 3: Sentiment toward subject
  - annotation_type: radio
    name: subject_sentiment
    description: "Does the verb cast the subject in a positive or negative light?"
    labels:
      - "Positive"
      - "Neutral"
      - "Negative"
    tooltips:
      "Positive": "The verb portrays the subject favorably"
      "Neutral": "The verb is neutral toward the subject"
      "Negative": "The verb portrays the subject unfavorably"

  # Step 4: Confidence
  - annotation_type: likert
    name: confidence
    description: "How confident are you in your annotations?"
    min_value: 1
    max_value: 5
    labels:
      1: "Very uncertain"
      2: "Somewhat uncertain"
      3: "Moderately confident"
      4: "Confident"
      5: "Very confident"
