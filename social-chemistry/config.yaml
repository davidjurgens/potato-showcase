# Social Chemistry 101 (Social Norms)
# Based on Forbes et al., EMNLP 2020
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.48/
#
# Social Chemistry catalogs rules-of-thumb (RoTs) for social/moral norms.
# Each RoT is annotated across 12 dimensions capturing different aspects
# of social judgment.
#
# Key Concepts:
# - Rule-of-Thumb (RoT): A descriptive norm like "It's rude to be late"
# - Situation: The context that evokes the RoT
# - Action: The specific behavior being judged
#
# 12 Annotation Dimensions:
# 1. Social judgment: Is the action good/bad/expected/unexpected?
# 2. Moral foundations: Care, fairness, loyalty, authority, purity
# 3. Cultural pressure: How strongly does society expect this?
# 4. Legality: Is this legal/illegal?
# 5. Agency: Who should do/avoid the action?
# 6. Anticipated agreement: Would others agree with this judgment?
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Consider the SPECIFIC situation, not abstract principles
# 2. Think about what MOST people in your culture would think
# 3. RoTs can conflict - the same action may have multiple valid judgments
# 4. Consider both the action and its consequences
