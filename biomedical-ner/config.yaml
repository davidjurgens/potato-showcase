# Biomedical Named Entity Recognition
# Based on standard biomedical NER annotation guidelines
# (JNLPBA, BC5CDR, NCBI Disease, i2b2, etc.)
#
# Entity Types:
# - Disease/Condition: Diseases, disorders, symptoms, findings
# - Medication/Drug: Medications, drugs, therapeutic agents
# - Procedure: Medical procedures, surgeries, treatments
# - Anatomy: Body parts, organs, tissues, cells
# - Gene/Protein: Genes, proteins, gene products
# - Chemical: Chemical compounds (non-drug)
# - Organism: Species, pathogens, organisms
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Annotate the full noun phrase, including modifiers
#    - "severe acute respiratory syndrome" not just "syndrome"
# 2. Include abbreviations when they stand alone
#    - "COVID-19", "HIV", "NSAID"
# 3. Do NOT include articles (a, the) in the span
# 4. For nested entities, annotate the outermost mention
# 5. Annotate each mention, even if repeated
# 6. When uncertain, prefer broader entity boundaries
#
# Difficult Cases:
# - "Heart attack" → Disease (entire phrase)
# - "Blood pressure" → can be Anatomy or finding depending on context
# - "Insulin treatment" → Medication (insulin) + Procedure (treatment)
