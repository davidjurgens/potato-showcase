      Mark all activity instances in the indoor home video.
      Multiple activities may occur simultaneously or sequentially.
      Use verb-object format labels (e.g., "opening door", "sitting on chair").

  ## Charades Activity Segmentation Task

  Your goal is to identify all activities in short indoor home videos.

  ### Video Characteristics:
  - Duration: ~30 seconds each
  - Setting: Indoor home environments
  - Content: Person(s) performing daily activities
  - Multiple activities often occur in sequence

  ### Annotation Format:
  Activities use **verb + object** composition:
  - "opening door" (not just "opening")
  - "sitting on chair" (not just "sitting")
  - "drinking from cup" (not just "drinking")

  ### How to Annotate:
  1. Watch the entire video first
  2. Replay and mark each activity:
     - Select the activity label
     - Mark START when action begins
     - Mark END when action completes
  3. Activities can OVERLAP (e.g., "holding phone" while "sitting on sofa")

  ### Boundary Guidelines:
  - **Start**: First intentional movement toward the action
  - **End**: Action is complete (door fully open, seated, etc.)
  - Include the full action, not just the peak moment

  ### Common Activity Categories:
  - **Door/Window**: opening, closing
  - **Furniture**: sitting on chair/sofa, standing up
  - **Objects**: holding, putting down (book, phone, cup)
  - **Appliances**: refrigerator, TV, lights
  - **Movement**: walking, running

  ### Tips:
  - Multiple activities can happen simultaneously
  - "Holding" actions continue until the object is put down
  - Don't annotate activities that happen off-screen
