# News Headline Emotion Roles (GoodNewsEveryone)
# Based on Bostan et al., LREC 2020
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.194/
#
# This task annotates emotions in news headlines with semantic roles:
# - Emotion: What emotion is conveyed?
# - Experiencer: Who feels the emotion?
# - Cause: What caused the emotion?
# - Target: What is the emotion directed at?
# - Cue: What words signal the emotion?
#
# Emotion Categories (Extended Plutchik):
# Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise (positive/negative),
# Disgust, Trust, Anticipation (positive/negative),
# Love, Pride, Guilt, Shame, Annoyance
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. First identify IF there's an emotion in the headline
# 2. Classify the emotion type
# 3. Identify semantic roles (may not all be present)
# 4. Consider both writer's emotion and reader's reaction
# 5. Headlines can evoke emotions even without explicit cues
