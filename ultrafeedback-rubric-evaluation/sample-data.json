    "response": "Normal computers use tiny switches that are either on or off, like light switches. Quantum computers are special because their switches can be on AND off at the same time, like magic! This lets them solve really hard puzzles much faster than normal computers."

    "response": "Here are 5 benefits of meditation:\n\n1. **Reduced Stress**: Meditation activates the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering cortisol levels and promoting relaxation.\n\n2. **Improved Focus**: Regular practice strengthens attention span and the ability to concentrate on tasks.\n\n3. **Better Sleep**: Meditation can help quiet racing thoughts that interfere with falling asleep.\n\n4. **Emotional Regulation**: It helps create space between stimulus and response, allowing for more thoughtful reactions.\n\n5. **Lower Blood Pressure**: Studies show meditation can reduce blood pressure by promoting relaxation and reducing stress hormones.\n\nNote: While research supports these benefits, results vary by individual and practice consistency."

    "response": "Here's how to reverse a string in Python without built-in reverse:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    reversed_str = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        reversed_str = char + reversed_str\n    return reversed_str\n\n# Example usage\nprint(reverse_string(\"hello\"))  # Output: olleh\n```\n\nAlternatively, using slicing (which is technically a Python feature but not a reverse function):\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string_slice(s):\n    return s[::-1]\n```\n\nThe first method manually builds the reversed string by prepending each character. Time complexity is O(n) for iteration, though string concatenation in Python can make it O(n²) in some implementations. For better performance with large strings, consider using a list and join."
