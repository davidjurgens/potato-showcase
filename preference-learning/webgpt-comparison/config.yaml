  ## WebGPT Answer Comparison

  Compare two AI-generated answers to the same question.

  ### What to evaluate:

  **Factual Accuracy**
  - Are the facts correct?
  - Are claims supported?
  - Any obvious errors?

  **Source Quality**
  - Are sources provided?
  - Are sources reliable?
  - Do sources support the claims?

  **Completeness**
  - Does it fully answer the question?
  - Are important aspects covered?
  - Appropriate level of detail?

  **Relevance**
  - Does it address what was asked?
  - Is the information pertinent?
  - Stays on topic?

  ### Guidelines:
  - Read the question carefully first
  - Evaluate each dimension independently
  - "About equal" is valid when truly indistinguishable
  - Note: One response may have used web search

  ### Tips:
  - Look for specific details and citations
  - Check if claims seem verifiable
  - Consider whether you'd trust the answer
  - More sources ≠ better (quality matters)
