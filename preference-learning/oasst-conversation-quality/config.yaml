  ## OpenAssistant Conversation Quality

  Rate AI assistant responses across multiple quality dimensions.

  ### Rating Scales (0-4):

  **Quality**: Overall response quality
  - 4: Excellent - couldn't be better
  - 3: Good - minor issues only
  - 2: Acceptable - noticeable issues
  - 1: Poor - significant problems
  - 0: Very poor - fails completely

  **Helpfulness**: Does it help the user?
  - Consider the user's apparent goal
  - Is information actionable?
  - Does it address the question?

  **Creativity**: Is it creative/original?
  - Only rate if relevant (skip for factual Q&A)
  - Novel approaches or perspectives
  - Engaging presentation

  **Humor**: Is it funny?
  - Only rate if humor was attempted
  - N/A for serious responses

  ### Quality Flags:

  **Truthfulness**: Is the content accurate?
  - "Cannot assess" for opinions or unknowable things

  **Harmlessness**: Could this cause harm?
  - Consider advice quality
  - Potential for misuse
  - Respectfulness

  **Spam**: Is this low-quality filler?
  - Nonsense or irrelevant text
  - Copied content
  - No genuine attempt to help

  ### Guidelines:
  - Rate based on the specific context
  - A simple question needs a simple answer
  - Don't penalize brevity if complete
