    "response": "Here's a Python function to calculate factorial:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nThis recursive implementation handles edge cases (negative numbers, 0, and 1) and calculates the factorial for positive integers."

    "response": "Imagine you have two magic coins. When you flip them, they always land the same way - if one shows heads, the other shows heads too, even if they're on opposite sides of the world! Scientists call this 'quantum entanglement.' It's like the coins are best friends who always match, no matter how far apart they are. This is one of the strangest and coolest things in science!"
