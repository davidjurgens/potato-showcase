    "question": "How does CRISPR gene editing work?",
    "response_a": "CRISPR uses a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location in DNA. The enzyme cuts both strands, and the cell's repair mechanisms either disable the gene or allow insertion of new sequences.",
    "response_b": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool adapted from bacterial immune systems. A guide RNA (gRNA) complementary to the target sequence directs Cas9 to make a double-strand break. This triggers either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), causing insertions/deletions, or homology-directed repair (HDR) for precise edits when a template is provided."
