  ## THUMOS14 Sports Action Localization Task

  Your goal is to identify and temporally localize sports actions in YouTube videos.

  ### The 20 THUMOS14 Action Classes:

  **Ball Sports:**
  - Baseball Pitch, Basketball Dunk, Billiards
  - Cricket Bowling, Cricket Shot
  - Frisbee Catch, Golf Swing
  - Soccer Penalty, Tennis Swing
  - Volleyball Spiking

  **Track & Field:**
  - Clean and Jerk, Hammer Throw
  - High Jump, Javelin Throw
  - Long Jump, Pole Vault
  - Shot Put, Throw Discus

  **Water Sports:**
  - Cliff Diving, Diving

  ### Annotation Guidelines:

  **Temporal Boundaries:**
  - **Start**: First frame of the action (wind-up/preparation counts)
  - **End**: Last frame of action completion (follow-through counts)

  **What to Include:**
  - Full motion from preparation to follow-through
  - Multiple instances if action repeats
  - Close-up and wide shots of the same action

  **What NOT to Include:**
  - Walking between actions
  - Celebrations after the action
  - Replays (annotate separately if distinguishable)

  ### Examples:
  - **Golf Swing**: From backswing start to follow-through end
  - **Basketball Dunk**: From jump initiation to landing
  - **Diving**: From leaving platform to entering water

  ### Tips:
  - Use frame stepping for precise boundaries
  - Slow playback helps with fast actions
  - Some videos have multiple instances of the same action
  - Background/filler content should NOT be annotated
