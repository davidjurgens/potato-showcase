  ## EPIC-KITCHENS Egocentric Action Annotation

  Annotate cooking actions from first-person (egocentric) video.

  ### Task:
  1. Mark the temporal boundaries of each action
  2. Label the VERB (what is being done)
  3. Label the NOUN (what object is involved)

  ### What counts as an action?
  - Any intentional interaction with an object
  - Starts when hands begin reaching/moving
  - Ends when the interaction is complete

  ### Common verb-noun pairs:
  - "take pan", "put plate", "open fridge"
  - "wash spoon", "cut vegetable", "pour water"
  - "turn-on tap", "close drawer", "mix bowl"

  ### Guidelines:
  - One action = one verb + one noun
  - If multiple objects, annotate the PRIMARY one
  - Mark ALL actions, even brief ones
  - Use free text for objects not in the list

  ### Egocentric video tips:
  - Hands often occlude objects - do your best
  - Fast movements may need frame-stepping
  - Camera shake is normal in egocentric video
