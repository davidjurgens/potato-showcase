  ## ActivityNet Temporal Localization Task

  Your goal is to identify and localize activity instances in untrimmed videos.

  ### What is Temporal Localization?
  - Finding the precise START and END times of activities
  - Videos may contain multiple activities or none at all
  - Activities may overlap or occur sequentially

  ### How to Annotate:
  1. Watch the video to understand its content
  2. For each activity you identify:
     - Select the activity type from the labels
     - Mark the START time (when activity begins)
     - Mark the END time (when activity ends)

  ### Defining Boundaries:
  - **Start**: First frame where the activity is clearly happening
  - **End**: Last frame where the activity is still happening
  - Include preparation if it's part of the activity
  - Exclude unrelated pauses or interruptions

  ### Activity Categories:

  **Sports:** basketball, soccer, swimming, running, gymnastics
  **Household:** cooking, cleaning, gardening
  **Personal Care:** brushing teeth, doing makeup
  **Music:** playing guitar, playing piano, singing
  **Outdoor:** hiking, fishing, camping

  ### Tips:
  - Use slow playback for precise boundaries
  - Zoom the timeline for long videos
  - One video may have multiple instances of the same activity
  - If unsure about boundaries, mark your best estimate
  - Skip segments that don't match any activity class
