  ## Movie Scene Classification Task

  Classify movie scenes by their visual and narrative attributes.

  ### Attributes to Label:

  **Place Type**: Where does the scene take place?

  **Time of Day**: When does the scene occur?

  **Weather**: What's the lighting/weather condition?

  **Scene Function**: What purpose does this scene serve narratively?

  **Shot Scale**: What's the typical camera distance?

  ### Tips:
  - Consider the OVERALL scene, not just one shot
  - Scene function can have multiple labels
  - If unsure, choose the most prominent/frequent option
