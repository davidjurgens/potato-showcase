  ## Video Summarization Task

  Select segments that should be included in a summary of each video.

  ### Goal:
  If the video were shortened to ~15% of its length, what parts should remain?

  ### What makes a good summary segment?
  - Captures key moments or highlights
  - Shows the main subject/action clearly
  - Is visually interesting or informative
  - Would make sense to someone who hasn't seen the full video

  ### Guidelines:
  - Mark all segments you think should be in the summary
  - Use "highly_important" for the absolute best moments
  - Try to select 10-20% of the video
  - Avoid: repetitive content, blurry/unclear footage, transitions

  ### Tips:
  - Watch the whole video first before marking
  - Consider what would be lost if a segment were removed
  - For action videos, focus on peak moments
  - For scenic videos, focus on the best views
