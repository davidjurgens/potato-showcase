  ## Dense Video Captioning Task

  Your goal is to segment the video into events and describe each one.

  ### Step 1: Identify Events
  - Watch the video and identify distinct events
  - Mark the START and END of each event
  - Events should be meaningful actions/happenings

  ### Step 2: Write Captions
  - Describe WHAT happens in each segment
  - Be specific: mention people, objects, actions
  - Start with a verb (e.g., "A woman picks up...")
  - Keep it concise but complete

  ### Caption Guidelines:
  - Describe visible actions, not intentions
  - Include relevant details (clothing, objects, location)
  - Use present tense
  - Don't describe audio unless relevant

  ### Example Captions:
  - "A chef chops vegetables on a cutting board"
  - "Two children run across a playground"
  - "The camera pans across a mountain landscape"
