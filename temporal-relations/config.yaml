# Temporal Relation Annotation
# Based on TimeML/TempEval annotation guidelines
#
# This task involves identifying temporal relations between:
# - Events (actions, states, occurrences)
# - Time expressions (dates, times, durations)
#
# Temporal Relations (TLINK types):
# - BEFORE: Event 1 ends before Event 2 begins
# - AFTER: Event 1 begins after Event 2 ends
# - SIMULTANEOUS: Events occur at the same time
# - INCLUDES: Event 1's timespan contains Event 2
# - IS_INCLUDED: Event 1 is contained within Event 2's timespan
# - VAGUE: Temporal relationship cannot be determined
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. First identify all events (verbs, nominalizations, states)
# 2. Identify all time expressions (dates, times, durations)
# 3. For each pair of adjacent/related events, determine their temporal relation
# 4. Use VAGUE only when there is genuine ambiguity
# 5. Consider both explicit markers (before, after, then) and implicit ordering
# 6. Pay attention to tense, aspect, and temporal adverbs
