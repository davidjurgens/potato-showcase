  ## YouTube Highlights Detection

  Identify the most highlight-worthy moments in each video.

  ### What is a highlight?
  - The moment you'd share with a friend
  - The part that makes the video worth watching
  - Peak action, emotion, or visual interest

  ### Domain-specific guidance:

  **Surfing**: Big waves, successful rides, wipeouts
  **Skating**: Tricks landing, impressive moves, falls
  **Gymnastics**: Difficult moves, perfect landings
  **Parkour**: Creative moves, big jumps, close calls
  **Dog**: Cute moments, tricks, funny behavior

  ### Guidelines:
  - Mark ALL highlight-worthy segments
  - Use "best_moment" for the single best highlight
  - Highlights are typically 2-10 seconds
  - Consider what would make a good thumbnail/preview

  ### Tips:
  - Put yourself in the viewer's shoes
  - Think about what would get the most engagement
  - Domain expertise helps identify skill-based highlights
