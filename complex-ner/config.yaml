# Complex Named Entity Recognition (MultiCoNER)
# Based on SemEval 2022/2023 MultiCoNER Shared Tasks
# Paper: https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.196/
#
# Traditional NER focuses on Person, Location, Organization.
# Complex NER handles challenging entities like:
# - Creative works ("Dial M for Murder", "Game of Thrones")
# - Products ("iPhone 15", "Tesla Model S")
# - Groups ("Anonymous", "BTS Army")
#
# Entity Types (Coarse-grained):
# - PER: Person names
# - LOC: Locations, facilities
# - CORP: Corporations, businesses
# - GRP: Other groups (bands, teams, movements)
# - PROD: Products (consumer goods, vehicles)
# - CW: Creative works (movies, books, songs)
#
# Challenges:
# - Creative works can be any linguistic form
# - Product names blend with common words
# - Group names may be descriptive phrases
# - Emerging entities lack context
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Mark the full entity span including modifiers
# 2. Creative works include titles in any form
# 3. Products include brand + product name
# 4. When uncertain, consider: would this have a Wikipedia page?
