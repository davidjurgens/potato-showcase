    "responses": [
      "Crack eggs, cook them, stir.",
      "Beat 2-3 eggs with a splash of milk. Heat butter in a pan over medium-low heat. Pour in eggs and gently stir with a spatula, pushing curds from edges to center. Remove when slightly wet - they'll finish cooking off heat. Season with salt and pepper.",

    "responses": [
      "The sky is blue because of the way light works.",
      "Sunlight contains all colors. When it hits our atmosphere, blue light scatters more than other colors because of its shorter wavelength. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.",
      "Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other visible light. Earth's atmosphere scatters short wavelengths more efficiently (Rayleigh scattering). Since blue scatters most, we see a blue sky. At sunset, light travels through more atmosphere, scattering away blue and leaving red/orange.",
      "The atmosphere scatters sunlight and blue scatters the most so we see blue."
