  ## Shot Boundary Detection Task

  Mark every transition between camera shots.

  ### Transition Types:
  - **Cut (c)**: Instantaneous change (most common)
  - **Dissolve (d)**: Two shots overlap/blend
  - **Fade In (i)**: From black to image
  - **Fade Out (o)**: From image to black
  - **Wipe (w)**: One shot pushes another off screen
  - **Other Gradual (g)**: Any other gradual transition

  ### Guidelines:
  - Mark at the FIRST frame of the new shot (for cuts)
  - For gradual transitions, mark the midpoint
  - Use frame stepping for accuracy
