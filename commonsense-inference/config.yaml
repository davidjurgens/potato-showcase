# Commonsense Inference (ATOMIC-style)
# Based on ATOMIC (Sap et al., AAAI 2019) and ATOMIC 2020 (Hwang et al.)
# Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05953
#
# ATOMIC captures inferential knowledge as if-then relations.
# Given an event, annotators provide commonsense inferences about
# mental states, causes, effects, and attributes.
#
# Inference Dimensions:
# - xIntent: Why did PersonX do this? (motivation/intent)
# - xNeed: What did PersonX need to do before this?
# - xWant: What will PersonX want to do after?
# - xEffect: What effect does this have on PersonX?
# - xReact: How does PersonX feel after?
# - oReact: How do others feel about this?
# - oWant: What will others want to do after?
# - oEffect: What effect does this have on others?
# - xAttr: How would PersonX be described? (attribute)
#
# Annotation Guidelines:
# 1. Read the event carefully
# 2. For each dimension, provide plausible inferences
# 3. "none" is acceptable if no inference applies
# 4. Be specific - "happy" is less useful than "relieved"
# 5. Consider typical/common scenarios, not edge cases
# 6. Multiple valid inferences may exist for each dimension

  # Step 1: PersonX's intent
  - annotation_type: radio
    name: xIntent
    description: "Why did PersonX do this? What was their motivation?"
    labels:
      - "To be helpful"

      "Other/unclear": "The motivation doesn't fit other categories or is unclear"

  # Step 2: PersonX's reaction

      "Neutral": "No strong emotional reaction"

  # Step 3: Others' reaction
  - annotation_type: radio
    name: oReact

      - "Happy for PersonX"
      - "Impressed"
      - "Indifferent"
