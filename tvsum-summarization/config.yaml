  ## Video Summarization Task

  Your goal is to help create automatic video summaries by rating the importance
  of video segments.

  ### Instructions:
  1. Watch the video carefully
  2. For each 2-second segment, rate its importance on a 1-5 scale:
     - **1**: Not important - Can be skipped entirely
     - **2**: Slightly important - Background/filler content
     - **3**: Moderately important - Relevant but not essential
     - **4**: Important - Should probably be in a summary
     - **5**: Very important - Must be included in any summary

  ### What makes a segment important?
  - Key events or actions
  - Emotional high points
  - Information that's essential to understanding the video
  - Visually striking or memorable moments

  ### Tips:
  - Compare segments relative to each other within the same video
  - Think: "If I only had 15 seconds, would I include this?"
  - Use keyboard shortcuts for faster annotation
