  ## Scene Boundary Detection Task

  Mark where each new SCENE begins in the video.

  ### What defines a scene boundary?
  - Change in location or setting
  - Significant time jump
  - Change in main subject/topic
  - Narrative shift

  ### Transition Types:
  - **Cut**: Instantaneous change between shots
  - **Gradual**: Fade, dissolve, or wipe transition

  ### Tips:
  - A scene is NOT the same as a shot (scenes contain multiple shots)
  - Mark the FIRST frame of the new scene
  - Use frame stepping for precision
